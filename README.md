# **About Me:**
  
  I'm a chemical engineering gradute who, after some years outside of school, rediscovered my love for programming. To that end, I picked up learning Full Stack Web Development a couple years ago as a hobby. Over this time, I have learned so much and continue to find ways to push my journey into development further and further.

  The majority of my development work is done on a system running Arch Linux. My interest in tinkering with code and fixing problems as given me love for a minimal OS like Arch.
  
  Web technologies that I work with are mainly:
  - Javascript
  - HTML/CSS
  - CSS preprocessors, such as LESS and SASS
  - Nodejs/Express
  - React
  - MongoDB
  - SQL
  
  Some other tech I have spent time with include:
