Hi, I’m Tyler. I am currently self teaching Web development using the Odin Project as well as other resources to help me along. 

I love hiking and getting outdoors and playing video games. 

I'm currently learning Web Development with Javascript/Nodejs using the LESS CSS Preprocessor to handle my CSS. 

Come check out my work!
